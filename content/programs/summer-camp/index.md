Each year, after school is out for summer, the Norwin School District offers fifteen STEM-focused summer camp programs that give Norwin students the opportunity to have fun and learn more in doing so. The Norwin Alumni & Friends Association is proud to offer two summer camp scholarships for two qualifying students.<!--more-->

NAFA summer camp scholarships cover the full camp fee of $120, and are available for all camps excluding scuba diving and advanced scuba diving. Scholarships are awarded on the basis of camp availability, financial need, and the student input statement, with all applications confidentially reviewed by a small committee consisting of Norwin teachers, principals, and NAFA members.

To be considered for a NAFA summer camp scholarship, please complete the application below no later than *May 1, 2020*. Recipients will be notified via email no later than May 15, 2020. A spot in the camp will be automatically reserved for you, but must be confirmed by completing the separate  camp registration form beginning *April 15, 2020*, [via the Norwin School District website](https://norwinsd.org).

**You must complete both the school district camp registration form and the scholarship application to be considered for a scholarship.**
