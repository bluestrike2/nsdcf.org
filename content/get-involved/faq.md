### Annual Day of Giving

This event takes place annually the Wednesday prior to Homecoming Weekend.  Donations may be made to the general fund or to an existing scholarship fund or program.  You may donate online or by check.  Non-specified contributions received this during The Day of Giving will be allocated to the fund(s) targeted for that year and identified in the Day of Giving promotions.  New or renewed memberships to the Norwin Alumni and Friends Association may also be completed on the Day of Giving.

### Tax Information

Norwin School District Community Foundation (NSDCF) is an approved 501\(c\)3 charitable non-profit charitable organization.  Your donation to support the programs and/or activities may be eligible as a tax deduction on your Pennsylvania tax form.

Businesses and individuals making a donation to the NSDCF receive will receive an acknowledgement letter that may be used as a document for tax purposes. You should review your donation with your financial advisor and/or a tax expert to assure your donation qualifies as a tax deduction.

##### Qualified Charitable Distributions from IRA Accounts

For those age 70 1/2 or older, you can use funds from your traditional IRA account to make a tax-free Qualified Charitable Distribution (QCD) directly to the Norwin School District Community Foundation or other qualified charitable organizations of your choice. Under current law, the maximum alloweable QCD is $100,000 per individual annually and is counted towards all or part of your required minimum distribution (RMD) for the tax year. As such, early planning is necessary to ensure compliance with QCD eligibility rules and avoid any lost opportunities or mistakes due to the timing of your QCD and your RMDs, as QCDs are not retroactive.

Should you decide to make a donation to NSDCF, have your IRA representative send your donation payable to:

> *Norwin School District Community Foundation*<br />
> 281 McMahon Drive<br />
> North Huntingdon, PA 15642.
