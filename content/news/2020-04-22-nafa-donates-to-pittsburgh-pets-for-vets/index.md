Thanks to the overwhelming support of the Norwin community through the purchase of our [Veteran's Day t-shirts]({{< ref "/news/2019-10-04-veterans-day-shirts/index.md" >}}) last fall, we're proud to announce that we were able to make a donation to the [Pittsburgh chapter](https://www.thinkingoutsidethecage.org/our-programs/veterans-services/) of [Pets for Vets](https://www.petsforvets.com). 

The Pittsburgh chapter of Pets for Vets is part of [Animal Friends](https://www.thinkingoutsidethecage.org/), a non-profit companion animal resource center founded in 1943 to provide a safe refuge for the animal companions of soldiers as they left for World War II.

While there, we were privileged to enjoy a tour of the Animal Friends of Pittsburgh facilities where we saw firsthand some of the work done for both Animal Friends and Pets by Vets. Their work helps touch the lives of Pittsburghers, both animal companions and their human friends.

### About Pets for Vets

The enduring bond humans share with animals has the power to reduce suffering, mitigate loneliness, improve mental well-being and bridge the gap between ourselves and others. For our returning troops, these benefits are especially important to help ease the transition into civilian life. 

Pets for Vets was created to improve the lives of both Veterans and animals by bringing them together in a thoughtful, caring way. Our goal is to give back to the brave servicemen and women who have given everything to our country, while finding homes for deserving shelter pets. By matching the right pet with the right Veteran, everyone wins! Shelter animals receive a second chance at life and Veterans receive a second chance at health and happiness.
