As a result of the unprecedented nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Norwin School District Community Foundation and the Norwin Alumni & Friends Association have decided to reschedule their annual Knight of Distinguished Alumni.

The Knight of Distinguished Alumni, originally scheduled for May 21, 2020, has been postponed. The event has been rescheduled to October 15, 2020, with reservations beginning September 1st.

We are grateful to the Norwin community for their support of this event, and we look forward to the opportunity to safely come together once again to recognize the achievements of Norwin alumni.
